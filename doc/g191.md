# Recommendation ITU-T G.191 - Software tools for speech and audio coding standardization

## Summary

Recommendation ITU-T G.191 provides source code for speech and audio processing modules for narrowband, wideband and super-wideband telephony applications. The set includes codecs, filters, noise generators.

This edition introduces changes to Annex A, which describes the ITU-T Software Tools (STL) containing a high-quality, portable C code library for speech processing applications. This release of the STL, also known as STL2023, incorporates:

* An implementation of P.50 fullband MNRU as described in ITU-T P.810.

* A tool for automatic instrumentation of speech and audio codecs to measure their computational complexity and memory.

Recommendation ITU-T G.191 includes an electronic attachment containing STL2023 and manual.

## 1. Scope

This Recommendation provides a set of common, coherent and portable signal processing tools to facilitate the development of speech and audio coding algorithms, in particular within the standardization environment where the following situations often happen:

* experimental results generated with different software tools may not be directly compared;

* software tools used by different organizations may not perfectly conform to related ITU‑T Recommendations, which may delay ITU-T standardization processes;

* ITU-T Recommendations may leave scope for different implementations;

* new speech and audio coding standards are increasing in complexity, leading to non‑bitexact specifications; furthermore, appropriate testing procedures to assure interoperability of different implementations are needed.

## 6. Software tools

To clarify the use of the set of software tools, arranged as a software tool library (STL), ITU-T makes the following recommendations:

1) The software tools specified in Annex A should be used as building modules of signal processing blocks to be used in the process of generation of ITU-T Recommendations, particularly those concerned with speech and audio coding algorithms.
1) The software tools specified in Annex A should be used as building modules of signal processing blocks to be used in the process of generation of ITU-T Recommendations, particularly those concerned with speech and audio coding algorithms.

2) Some of the tools shall be used in procedures for the verification of interoperability of ITU‑T standards, mainly of speech and audio coding algorithms whose description is in terms of non-bitexact specifications.

3) The use of these modules should be made strictly in accordance with the technical instructions of their attached documentation, and should respect the following terms.

The software tools are maintained on an open-source collaboration platform [b-STLgit]. The build toolchain is implemented using the CMake framework [b-CMake] to generate build scripts crafted for the target platform and to execute regression tests for each module in the STL.

## 7. License and copyright

The modules in the ITU-T STL are free software; they can be redistributed or modified under the terms of Annex B; this applies to any of the versions of the modules in the STL.

The STL has been carefully tested and it is believed that both the modules and the example programs on their usage conform to their description documents. Nevertheless, the ITU-T STL is provided "as is", in the hope that it will be useful, but without any warranty.

The STL is intended to help the scientific community to achieve new standards in telecommunications more efficiently, and for such must not be sold, entirely or in parts. The original developers, except where otherwise noted, retain ownership of their copyright, and allow their use under the terms and conditions of Annex B.
