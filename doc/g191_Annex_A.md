### n.6) Basic operators which use 32-bit precision multiply

Name: `enh32.c`

Associated header file: `enh32.h`, `stl.h`

Basic operators in this clause are useful for fast Fourier transform (FFT) and scaling functions where the result of a 32\*16 or 32\*32 arithmetic operation is rounded, and saturated to a 32-bit value. There is no accumulation of products in these functions. In functions that accumulate products, you should use basic operators in Section n.5.
